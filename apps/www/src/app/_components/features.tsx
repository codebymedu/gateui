        After I finished reputable.so, I was reflecting in the development
        process, well as its clear already, what took the most time was
        authentication.
        <br />
        <br />
        Since I have a lot of ideas, and love to build a lot of apps (
        <a
          href="https://codebymedu.com"
          target="_blank"
          className="text-blue-600 hover:undercover"
        >
          check my portfolio
        </a>
        ) I decided I have to do something about it.
        <br />
        <br />
        Since I love Supabase and having full access to my code, I decided
        against using existing identity managers (such as Clerk)
        <br />
        <br />
        That's when I had the idea to create a reusable library. So I used all
        the code from Reputable.so and all the learnings to create GateUI.
        <br />
        <br /> I actually ended up deleting the authenticaton in Reputable and
        replacing it with GateUI completely.
